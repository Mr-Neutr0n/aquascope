"""Advanced study methods: change, models, projections and regions, as study steps.

The single-gauge study answers "what is the 100-year flow here, assuming the
past is a fair sample of the future". The functions in this module answer the
questions that come after it, each as one JSON-returning step a plan can name:

- :func:`change_points`: is the record stationary? Pettitt's test for a step
  change, PELT for the segments and Mann-Kendall with Sen's slope for a trend,
  on the annual maxima or the annual means. The verdict gates every method
  that assumes stationarity (#376).
- :func:`nonstationary_flood`: a GEV whose location moves with time, next to
  the stationary fit, with the likelihood-ratio test and AIC that say whether
  the extra parameter earns its place, and the T-year level at the start of
  the record, today and at a horizon.
- :func:`pot_flood`: peaks over a threshold (declustered) fitted to a
  Generalised Pareto, which uses every large flood rather than one per year.
- :func:`catchment_model`: GR4J calibrated on the gauge's flow and ERA5
  rainfall and FAO-56 reference evaporation (split-sample, with an
  uncertainty band scored on the validation years), and "what if" runs with
  the rainfall and evaporation changed.
- :func:`climate_projection`: CMIP6 HighResMIP change factors at the point
  (seven models, Open-Meteo, bias-corrected onto ERA5-Land): rainfall,
  evaporation, temperature and the wettest day, and, given a calibrated GR4J,
  the change in mean flow, low flow and the flood quantile model by model.
- :func:`regional_flood` and :func:`compare_gauges`: the gauges around the
  site studied together (Hosking and Wallis index flood, field significance of
  the trends) or side by side.

Everything runs in CPython and in the Explorer's Pyodide worker with numpy,
scipy and pandas: the station records come through
:func:`aquascope.explore.fetch_series` (the Archive first), the forcing and
the projections from Open-Meteo (keyless, CORS-enabled). No model sits
between the numbers and the result; each payload carries ``methods`` with the
citations and ``notes`` with what the numbers can and cannot support.

    the point. The last ``years`` of overlap are split in two: the first half
    calibrates (after a ``warmup_days`` spin-up), the second half validates.
    A 90 % band from the validation residuals (heteroscedastic, in the square
    root of flow) is scored by how often the observations fall inside it.

    ``scenarios`` are ``{"label", "dp_pct", "dpet_pct", "dt_c"}``: rainfall
    and evaporation scaled by the percentages (a temperature change alone
    becomes ``pet_pct_per_c`` percent of evaporation per degree, a stated
    assumption). Each is simulated over the whole period with the calibrated
    parameters and reported as the change in mean flow, low flow (Q95, the
    flow exceeded 95 % of days), high flow (Q05) and the median annual maximum.

    ``snow`` puts a degree-day snow store in front of GR4J (two more
    calibrated parameters, :func:`aquascope.models.rainfall_runoff.degree_day_snow`).
    ``"auto"`` (the default) turns it on when at least
