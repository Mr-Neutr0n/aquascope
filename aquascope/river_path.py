"""What a river passes: the dams on its way to the sea, the dams upstream of a reach, the countries it crosses.

The companions of :func:`aquascope.rivers.trace_downstream` (#516), kept apart so ``rivers`` stays about the
network itself:

* :func:`dams_along` lists the Global Dam Watch dams within a small buffer of a traced path, in the order the
  water reaches them, with name, storage capacity, main use and the degree of regulation where GDW gives it.
* :func:`upstream_dams` finds the dams upstream of a reach: the candidates in the basin's bounding box from the
  same mirror, each matched to its river reach in the stream tiles and kept when that reach drains to this one.
  With ``with_flow`` it adds the degree of regulation at the reach: the storage upstream as a share of a year's
  mean flow (GEOGLOWS v2 annual averages, modelled).
* :func:`countries_along` names the countries a path crosses, from Natural Earth's 1:50m admin-0 boundaries.

Data and licences. The dams come from the Archive's Global Dam Watch v1.0 mirror (CC BY 4.0), cell-sorted in
2-degree cells and read with :mod:`aquascope.context`'s readers; until that mirror is published every function
says so and the rest of the answer stands. The boundaries are Natural Earth (public domain), read from the
``world-atlas`` 2.0.2 TopoJSON on jsDelivr (CORS open, checked 2026-10-08). They show borders as Natural Earth
draws them, which is not a position on any dispute. Everything here is plain Python, so the Explorer's Pyodide
worker runs it unchanged.
