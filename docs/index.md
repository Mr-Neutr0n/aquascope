AquaScope unifies **37 global water-data sources** behind one Python schema. On top of that it layers a full scientific computing stack, from **flood-frequency methods** to **FAO-56 crop water requirements**, wrapped in an AI engine that scores **27 research methodologies** against your dataset and auto-executes **26 analysis pipelines**. Regression checks include the CAMELS benchmark with 3,200+ tests across the project.
The daily benchmark inputs are synthetic; flood benchmarks also use observed USGS annual peaks.
See [validation scope](validation_scope.md) for comparators and limitations.

## Install

```bash
pip install aquascope              # core: collectors + hydrology
pip install "aquascope[all]"       # everything: ML, viz, spatial, dashboard

## What you can do

- 🌊 **Pull water data** from USGS, NOAA NWPS, Colorado DWR/CDSS, the US Water Quality Portal, England's Environment Agency, France Hub'Eau, Germany PEGELONLINE, Ireland OPW, Greece Hydroscope, Poland IMGW-PIB, EU WFD, Taiwan MOENV / WRA / CWA, Japan MLIT, Korea WAMIS, India WRIS, South Africa DWS, Australia BOM, Brazil ANA Hidroweb, CAMELS-CL and CAMELS-BR, GRDC, GEMStat, Copernicus ERA5, OpenMeteo, FAO AQUASTAT, FAO WaPOR and UN SDG 6, with one unified Python API.
- 📈 **Run hydrological analyses**: flood frequency (GEV / LP3 / Gumbel / non-stationary GEV, with separate EMA routines), baseflow separation, rating curves, and 22 hydrological signatures.
- 🌾 **Plan agricultural water**: FAO-56 Penman–Monteith ET₀, crop water requirements for 26 crops (olive, grape, citrus and winter wheat resolved by variety and canopy), irrigation scheduling, and soil water balance with auto-irrigation.
- 🤖 **Ask the AI engine**: describe your goal in plain English, get a recommended methodology scored against your dataset, and auto-execute it.
- 🧑‍🔬 **Run a study**: from a question to a gated plan and a report bundle, keyless. The [advanced studies](advanced_studies.md) test whether the flood is changing, calibrate GR4J for "what if" scenarios and carry CMIP6 models through it to 2050.
- 🧭 **Read the context of any place**: `aquascope context LAT LON` (also over MCP and in the Explorer's Context tab): flood events in the news and Sentinel-1 radar floods 2014-2024, surface water since 1984, modelled flood depth, dams, soil, actual ET and the nearest rain gauge, each with its licence. See [the Explorer docs](explorer.md#context-of-a-place).
- 📊 **Visualise and report**: 17 plot types, Q-Q / P-P diagnostics, Markdown / HTML reports with embedded figures, threshold alerts (WHO / EPA / EU WFD).
- 🗺️ **Spatial hydrology**: DEM processing, D8 flow direction, watershed delineation, Strahler ordering.
